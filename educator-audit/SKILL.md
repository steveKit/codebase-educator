# Educator Audit

Validate and repair the educator-briefs vault. Catches what codebase-educator's
creation process misses: orphaned wikilinks, registry drift, broken external
URLs, missing backlinks, and section quality gaps.

**Vault path:** `~/.claude/educator-briefs/` (symlink — use this, not `/mnt/`).

**Arguments**: $ARGUMENTS

## Modes

| Input | Scope | What's checked |
|---|---|---|
| No argument | **Vault-wide** | All projects, all concepts, full registry, `_index.md` |
| `<project-name>` | **Single brief** | That project's sections + its concept links + registry entries |

## Process

### Phase 1: Inventory

1. **Load registry** — Read `_concepts/_registry.yaml` into memory. If it
   doesn't exist, note this as a critical finding (codebase-educator should
   have created it).

2. **Discover projects** — Glob `~/.claude/educator-briefs/*/` to find all
   project subdirectories. Exclude `_concepts/`. If a `<project-name>` argument
   was provided, filter to just that project (error if it doesn't exist).

3. **Discover concept files** — Glob `~/.claude/educator-briefs/_concepts/*.md`
   to get the list of actual concept pages on disk.

4. **Read `_index.md`** — Parse the Projects table to know which projects are
   currently indexed.

### Phase 2: Link Integrity

Run these checks per project (or all projects in vault-wide mode):

#### 2a. Wikilink Resolution

For each project's section files (`*.md` in the project folder):

1. **Extract all wikilinks** — Grep for `\[\[([^\]]+)\]\]` patterns.
2. **Classify each link:**
   - `[[concept-name]]` or `[[concept-name|Display]]` → concept link
   - `[[project/section]]` or `[[project/section|Display]]` → cross-ref link
   - `[[project/_<project-name>_overview|display]]` → project link (used in concept backlinks)
3. **Validate concept links:**
   - Strip alias (`[[foo|Bar]]` → `foo`)
   - Check that `foo` exists as a key in the registry AND as a file
     `_concepts/foo.md` on disk
   - If in registry but no file → **critical** (registry corrupt)
   - If file exists but not in registry → **fixable** (add to registry)
   - If neither → **orphaned link** (fixable — see Phase 3)
4. **Validate cross-ref links:**
   - `[[project/section]]` → verify `section` is one of the known section
     filenames: `_<project-name>_overview`, `architecture`, `technology-choices`,
     `design-patterns`, `key-decisions`, `gaps-vulnerabilities`,
     `dependencies`, `evolution`, `testing-strategy`, `if-starting-over`,
     `learning-path`, `glossary`, `resources`
   - Verify the target project folder exists on disk
5. **Check casing** — All concept link targets must be `lowercase-with-hyphens`.
   Flag any that contain uppercase characters.

#### 2b. External URL Validation

For each project's section files:

1. **Extract all markdown links** — Grep for `\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)` patterns.
2. **Categorize URLs:**
   - **Registry URLs** (npm, PyPI, crates.io, pkg.go.dev, GitHub) — validate
     by pattern only. These follow predictable formats; if the pattern is
     well-formed, the URL is almost certainly valid. Check:
     - `npmjs.com/package/<name>` — name is non-empty
     - `pypi.org/project/<name>/` — name is non-empty
     - `crates.io/crates/<name>` — name is non-empty
     - `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` — both segments present
   - **Known-stable docs** — Major technology docs sites (MDN, React, Express,
     TypeScript, Rust, Python, Go, etc.) are pattern-validated only. If the URL
     follows the standard docs site structure, accept it.
   - **Other URLs** — WebFetch with a budget of **10 calls per audit run**.
     Prioritize URLs that appear in multiple sections or look unusual. For each,
     check that the page loads (non-404). Record failures.
3. **Flag issues:**
   - Malformed URLs (missing scheme, broken encoding)
   - Empty link text `[](url)` or empty URL `[text]()`
   - Duplicate URLs pointing to different link texts (inconsistency, not error)

#### 2c. `resources.md` Completeness

For each project:

1. **Collect all external URLs** from every section file except `resources.md`
2. **Read `resources.md`** and extract its URLs
3. **Diff** — any URL present in sections but missing from `resources.md` is
   a gap. Report it.

### Phase 3: Registry & Index Consistency

#### 3a. Registry ↔ Filesystem Sync

Compare the registry keys against actual `_concepts/*.md` files:

| Condition | Severity | Auto-fix |
|---|---|---|
| Key in registry, no `.md` file | Critical | Create concept page from registry context |
| `.md` file exists, no registry key | Fixable | Add key to registry, scan "Seen In" for project list |
| Registry lists a project that has no folder | Warning | Remove stale project from registry entry |

#### 3b. Concept Backlink Completeness

For each concept in the registry:

1. Get the list of projects that wikilink to this concept (from Phase 2a data)
2. Get the list of projects in the concept's "Seen In" section
3. **Missing backlinks** — project uses the concept but isn't listed in "Seen In"
   → fixable
4. **Stale backlinks** — project listed in "Seen In" but doesn't actually
   wikilink the concept (or project folder doesn't exist) → fixable

#### 3c. `_index.md` Completeness

1. Compare discovered project folders against the `_index.md` Projects table
2. **Missing entries** — project folder exists but isn't in the table → fixable
3. **Stale entries** — project listed but folder doesn't exist → fixable
4. **Concepts by Category** — verify every concept page is listed under its
   category. Cross-reference the `category` field from each concept's YAML
   frontmatter.

#### 3d. Cross-Project Connections

For each project in scope:

1. Use the registry to find concepts shared with other projects
2. Read the project's `_<project-name>_overview.md` "Cross-Project Connections" section
3. **Missing connections** — shared concept exists but no connection block
   in either project's overview → fixable
4. **One-directional connections** — project A mentions B but B doesn't
   mention A → fixable

### Phase 4: Section Quality

Per-project quality checks. These are **reported, not auto-fixed** — fixing
requires regeneration, not mechanical repair.

#### 4a. Structure

For each section file:

| Check | Pass criteria |
|---|---|
| YAML frontmatter | Has `source`, `section`, `difficulty`, `quality-note` fields |
| Relevant files block | Present (except `_<project-name>_overview`, `if-starting-over`, `resources`) |
| "Why This Matters" callout | Present at end of section |
| Section file exists | All 13 expected files present in project folder |

#### 4b. Depth

| Section category | Min words | Min code examples |
|---|---|---|
| Implementation-heavy (`architecture`, `design-patterns`, `key-decisions`, `testing-strategy`, `gaps-vulnerabilities`) | 300 | 3 |
| Analytical (`technology-choices`, `dependencies`, `evolution`, `if-starting-over`) | 200 | 1 |
| Reference (`learning-path`, `glossary`, `resources`, `_<project-name>_overview`) | Complete coverage | 0 |

Count words (excluding YAML frontmatter and code blocks) and code fences per file.

#### 4c. Mermaid Diagrams

For each ` ```mermaid ` block:

- Has a direction declaration (`graph TD`, `graph LR`, `sequenceDiagram`, etc.)
- Every `subgraph` has a matching `end`
- Node IDs don't contain unescaped special characters
- No duplicate node IDs within a diagram

Report issues with file path and line number.

#### 4d. Inline Link Density

Check first-mention linking per section (spot check, not exhaustive):

- `technology-choices.md` — Stack Summary table should have links in every row
- `dependencies.md` — every dependency name should be a link on first mention
- `glossary.md` — framework-specific terms should link to docs

Report sections that appear under-linked.

### Phase 5: Auto-Fix

Apply fixes for all issues marked **fixable** in Phases 2-3. Group by type:

#### 5a. Orphaned Wikilinks

For each orphaned concept link:

1. Check if a similar concept already exists in the registry (fuzzy match —
   e.g., `middleware-pattern` vs `middleware`). If so, fix the wikilink to
   use an alias: `[[middleware|middleware-pattern]]`
2. If no similar concept exists, create the concept page using the concept
   template from `codebase-educator/references/concept-template.md`. Fill in:
   - `concept`: infer from the link text
   - `category`: infer from the section context where the link appears
   - `difficulty`: infer from the section's difficulty tag
   - "Seen In" entry for the current project
   - Mark the page with `<!-- auto-generated by educator-audit -->` after
     the YAML frontmatter so it can be identified for later enrichment
3. Add the concept to the registry

#### 5b. Registry Repairs

- Add missing keys (from files without registry entries)
- Remove stale project references
- Sort registry alphabetically by key

#### 5c. Backlink Repairs

- Append missing "Seen In" entries to concept pages
- Remove stale "Seen In" entries for deleted projects

#### 5d. Index Repairs

- Add missing project rows to `_index.md` Projects table (read `_<project-name>_overview.md`
  for the summary and date)
- Remove stale project rows
- Add missing concepts to the "Concepts by Category" section

#### 5e. Cross-Project Connection Repairs

- Add missing reciprocal connection entries to `_<project-name>_overview.md` files
- Format matches the codebase-educator convention:
  ```
  Concepts shared with [[<other-project>/_<other-project>_overview|<Display Name>]]:
  - **<Concept>** — <how this project uses it>; <how the other uses it>.
  ```
- For auto-generated entries, use the "Seen In" descriptions from concept pages
  as the usage summary. Mark with `<!-- auto-generated by educator-audit -->`

#### 5f. `resources.md` Gap Fill

- Append missing URLs to the appropriate table in `resources.md`
- Use the link text and URL from the section where the link was found
- Add to the most appropriate category (Core Stack, Dependencies, Pattern
  References, or Further Reading)

### Phase 6: Commit & Push

If any files were modified:

1. `cd ~/.claude/educator-briefs`
2. `git checkout -b audit/<project-name>` (or `audit/vault-YYYY-MM-DD` for
   vault-wide)
3. Stage modified files: `git add -A`
4. Show `git diff --cached --stat` to the user
5. **Wait for user approval before committing.** Present the summary of
   changes and ask "Commit these fixes?"
6. On approval:
   - `git commit -m "fix(<scope>): audit repairs — <summary>"`
   - `git push -u origin audit/<scope>`
   - `gh pr create --title "fix(<scope>): audit repairs" --body "<details>" --fill`
   - `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`
   - `git checkout main && git pull`

### Phase 7: Report

Present a structured summary:

```
## Educator Audit Report — <scope>

### Link Integrity
- Wikilinks checked: N
- Orphaned links found: N (N fixed)
- External URLs checked: N
- Broken URLs found: N
- resources.md gaps: N (N filled)

### Registry & Index

### Summary
<one-paragraph overall assessment>
```

For vault-wide audits, break down findings per project before the totals.

## Guidelines

- **Fix what's mechanical, report what's creative.** Orphaned links, registry
  sync, and missing backlinks can be fixed automatically. Thin sections and
  missing code examples require regeneration — just report them.
- **Never delete a concept page.** Even if no project currently links to it,
  it may have been delinked by mistake. Flag it as "unreferenced" instead.
- **Preserve existing content.** When appending backlinks or connection entries,
  never modify existing text in the file — only append.
- **Registry is the source of truth.** When registry and filesystem disagree,
  investigate both before deciding which to fix. The registry is usually right
  for concept-to-project mappings; the filesystem is usually right for
  concept existence.
- **WebFetch budget is firm.** 10 calls max per audit run. Prioritize URLs
  that look suspicious or appear in multiple briefs. Pattern-validated URLs
  (registries, major docs sites) don't count against the budget.
- **Auto-generated markers.** Always mark auto-created content with
  `<!-- auto-generated by educator-audit -->` so codebase-educator can
  enrich it on a future analysis pass.
- **Idempotent.** Running the audit twice in a row with no changes between
  runs should produce zero findings on the second run. If it doesn't,
  the audit has a bug.
- **Ground every finding in evidence.** Every issue reported must
  reference a specific file and the exact content that triggered it.
  If a check is inconclusive (e.g., a URL cannot be verified within
  the WebFetch budget), report it as "unverified" rather than
  assuming pass or fail.
